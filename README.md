Perceptron Training
This file contains a base mutable machine learning algorithm in python that I had developed originally to train on a 
practice dataset to predict malignant and benign cancer tumors. 

The goal for this file is to be a blueprint for further machine learning algorithms I may develop in the future, as well as 
being a file I can use and change varibles to train on another simple dataset. 
(This file was originally tested and debugged in Google Colab)
