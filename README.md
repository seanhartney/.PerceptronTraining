Perceptron Training

This file contains a base mutable machine learning algorithm in python that I had developed originally to train on a 
practice dataset to predict malignant and benign cancer tumors. 

The goal for this file is to be a blueprint for further machine learning algorithms I may develop in the future, as well as 
being a file I can use and change varibles to train on another simple dataset. 
(This file was originally tested and debugged in Google Colab)

Included in the file are several test cases that can be used to assess performance of the member functions.
There are also comments and notes about how to implement datasets and where to change default iteration and learning rate values.

The perceptron uses the following formula:
y^=f(b+w1x1+w2x2+w3x3+â‹¯+wMxM)
